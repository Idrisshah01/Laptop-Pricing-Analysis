# Laptop-Pricing-Analysis
End-to-End Data Analytics project analysing pricing behaviour, VFM scoring, and performance insights across 5000+ laptop listings.

This repository contains a comprehensive data analytics project focused on understanding how laptop pricing varies across brands, specifications, performance scores, and category segments.
The project includes complete data cleaning, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, dashboard development, and a structured reporting workflow.

Objective

To analyze 5,000+ laptop listings to identify:

True pricing drivers

Value-for-money models

Overpriced models

Correlation between performance and pricing

Brand influence on price

Category-wise pricing trends (Budget, Mid-Range, Premium, Luxury)

Key Project Activities
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Standardized RAM, Storage, Weight, and Price units

Treated missing values using median/mode imputation

Removed extreme outliers using IQR

Converted inconsistent data formats

Validated numerical ranges for performance, ratings, and pricing

2. Feature Engineering

Value-for-Money (VFM) Score

Overpriced Score

Performance Index

Price Category Segmentation (Budget, Mid-Range, Premium, Luxury)

Derived comparative metrics for better insight extraction

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Price distribution by brand, processor, RAM, storage

RAM vs Price and Storage vs Price trend lines

Category-wise average pricing

OS distribution and impact

Performance vs Price correlation (R² calculation)

Identification of top 10 VFM and top 10 overpriced laptops

4. Dashboard Development

A fully interactive Excel Dashboard featuring:

RAM vs Price

Storage vs Price

OS Market Share

Brand-wise Avg Price

Price Category Distribution

VFM Ranking Table

Overpriced Model Ranking

5. Reporting & Presentation

Delivered:

A professional PDF report with all insights

A structured PPT presentation summarizing methodology, findings, and recommendations

Key Insights

Laptop pricing is primarily brand-driven, not performance-driven

Performance & gaming metrics show near-zero correlation with price (R² ≈ 0)

Mid-Range laptops offer the highest value-for-money

RAM > 16GB does not significantly increase price

SSD contributes more strongly to price than HDD/Hybrid storage

Premium brands like Apple and Microsoft dominate the overpriced segment
